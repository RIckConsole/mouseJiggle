# Mouse Jiggler
Is your hand getting tired from waking your PC? Do you want to appear online while you take a nap? If so, keep reading. 

Running the binary without arguments will start jiggling your cursor. Press CTRL+C to stop the program and get back control of your mouse.

There are also some command line arguments you can add to slightly change its functionality:

`.\mouseJiggle.exe --help`

```
  Flags:
       --version    Displays the program version string.
    -h --help       Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
    -r --random     Enable random mouse movements
    -i --interval   Set the time (in seconds) between mouse movements (default: 1)
```
